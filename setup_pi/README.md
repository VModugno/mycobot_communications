# setup_pi
If you are configuring many of the robot arms, you will need to setup our configurations. This includes broadcasting a wifi network automatically (setting up the raspberry pi in AP mode), installing docker, and pulling our docker image.

You can copy/paste or clone this repo, and run it with sudo:
```
sudo bash setup_pi.sh
```
